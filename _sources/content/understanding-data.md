# Part 1: Understanding Data

The first portion of the course focuses on the basics of understanding
data and the processes that generate it. Quantitative and statistical
understanding of a dataset require clearly defining what is being
measured and in what ways. A tabular data structure is the natural
framework working toward these goals.

This part of the course covers:
* How tabular data structures describe observations of real world
  pheonomena.
* How to compute with tabular data structures to compute quantitative
  descriptions of data.
* Understanding the connection between data in table and the process
  that generated it, in order to make inferences about events in the
  real world.
