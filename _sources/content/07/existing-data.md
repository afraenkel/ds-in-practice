# Using Existing Data

The Internet has coincided with an unprecedented expansion of the
generation, storage, and collection of data. It contains large amounts
of historical records, both archived events of the physical world
(e.g. news stories), as well as human behaviors taking place on the
Internet (e.g. social network behaviors). The collation of data in one
place, making found data accessible to individuals in ways never
before imaginable.

However, this comes with concerns and responsibilities: using 'found
data' often obscures the origins and context of that
data. Do the individuals in the dataset consent to how the data are
being used? Are the unknown origins and mechanisms behind the
dataset invalidating the conclusions being drawn with the data?


Is it ethical to use a
dataset that contains individuals who don't consent to it's use? The
individuals contained in datasets represent or describe *humans* and
human activity. It's important to recognize and respect this
reality.

**Example:** For an analysis of a famous example (Pima Indians
Diabetes dataset) of this, see
[article](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/693853?mobileUi=0&journalCode=osiris).

**Example:** Datasets of convenience are often used to build
models. However correct conclusions and accurate predictions require a
representative sample of the population in question. Being skeptical
of the origins of a dataset prevents poor conclusions being drawn
using the dataset. This often occurs when Data Scientists use *someone
else's* model to draw conclusions. For example, see
