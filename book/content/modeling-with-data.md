# Part 3: Modeling with Data

The last portion of the course focuses on building models to answer questions and solve problems using data. These models may be used for either statistical inference or prediction. The material in this section focuses on the overall structure of a modeling pipeline and observations on how to assess the quality of a given model.

The sections in this part cover:
* Statistical models and modeling pipelines.
* Bias and Variance (choosing a good model).
* Evaluating a model for fairness.
