# Part 2: Collecting Data and Extracting Information

The second portion of the course focuses on typical scenarios of data
collection. Data collection either consists of experimental design, to
generate new data for building models, or using existing data to
build models.

While science has traditionally focused on experimental design, the
massive and indiscriminate collection of data has made using existing
data for new problems more common. This section focuses on the process
of finding data and transforming it into a tabular structure that can
be analyzed using the techniques of Part 1 of the course.

The sections in this part cover:
* Considerations for assessing and handling existing datasets
* Collecting data from the internet (over HTTP)
* Transforming non-tabular data into tabular data (what are the
  observations?)
* Transforming text data into quantitative features (what are the measurements?)
