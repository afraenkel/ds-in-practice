    "    - Disadvantages: relatively new feature in Pandas that may not always be available to use.\n",

Different data processing and storage systems may use different conventions (e.g. `NULL`, `None`, `\"\"`) or may disallow missing values entirely. This section focuses on strategies for *identifying* the missing values in a dataset; later, the course confronts the problem of how to handle the identified missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of 'placeholder' missing values that are not obviously missing at first glance:\n",
    "1. The integer `0` is a common stand-in for missing values, especially when the value is unlikely to occur in a dataset. For example, someone of age \n",
    "1. The integer `-1` is a common stand-in for missing values for columns containing non-negative values. For example, a column containing the \"number of children in a family\" might use `-1` as a missing value.\n",
    "1. `1900` and `1970` are common placeholder for missing dates in Excel and UNIX respectively. Each of these conventions picks a time as 'time zero' and stores dates and times as \"time elapsed since time zero\" (1970 was roughly the year UNIX was created). In this way, these placeholders are both special case of using `0` as a missing value."

    "* While this is a real location, it's location in the middle of the Atlantic ocean makes it highly unlikely to be a meaningful value.\n",

    "The provenance of a dataset, from a real-world event to a dataset displayed in a notebook, is often long and complicated.  However, for this data to be of any use, one must assess how well it captures the \"reality\" it's meant to describe. Once a dataset is properly typed, it should be assessed for its faithfulness to the data generating process.\n",

    "- Are there dates in the future for events that occurred the past?\n",
    "- Are there locations in the dataset that don't exist?\n",
    "- Are there negative counts? (is that a missing value?)\n",
    "- Are names misspelled? Do single names have variants such as nicknames?\n",
    "- Are there unreasonably large outliers?\n",

    "Assessing for faithfulness involves being skeptical of the data known data provenance and doing research into the assumptions on how the data were generated. This assessment generally involves understanding and identifying problems with the data, then attempting to \"fix\" the problem. How to fix unfaithful data depends on the context:\n",

The decisions involved in developing data cleaning code often uses domain-specific judgment calls that are far from obvious to someone attempting to understand the process (including the developer themselves, not long after writing the code). Data Scientists should write organized, easy-to-read, easy-to-adapt data cleaning code.\n",
